# ShinyApp

In here, I have created an app to show the total number of points for every NBA players. The app will show the progress of each player to reach their points currently throughout the season. In my app, you can see his points development as well as the table below to see how many seasons he is playing alongside with how many points the player has scored throughout the year.  

Here is the link to my app: https://ducminhngo871.shinyapps.io/TotalPointsNBAPlayers/?_ga=2.70998032.163317143.1634274695-1503300505.1633014426
